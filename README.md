If you are using a version below `0.0.4`, please upgrade to avoid [potentially logging sensitive user information](https://github.com/greena13/snake-eyes/issues/1)  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'snake-eyes'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To use SnakeEyes, simply add the following to the top of any controller in which you wish to have snake case parameters. All controllers that inherit from it shall also have the behaviour 

```ruby
class JsonController < ApplicationController
  snake_eyes_params
  
  def show
    #reference the params hash as normal  
  end
end
```

## Configuration

By default SnakeEyes logs the snake case parameters to the Rails console. You can prevent this behaviour by configuring the gem:

```ruby
SnakeEyes.configuration do |config|
  config.log_snake_eyes_parameters = false
end
```
